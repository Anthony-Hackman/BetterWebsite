            <p>My name is Anthony Hackman I'm a transitioning veteran with a passion for computer science. I enjoy learning new technologies, and building things.
                I grew up Cincinnati Ohio where I married my highschool sweetheart. I joined the Army in January of 2017 where I served about seven years. My first computer
                as a child was still equipped with Microsoft DOS (soon to be replaced by Windows 95).
